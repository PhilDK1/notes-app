## notes-app
A small group project for taking notes in STEM courses.
This app is planned to be used as an alternative to using LATEX for typing up equations and diagrams during lectures, given the limitations of using LaTex in a lecture setting.


The goal is to create an intuitive and efficient application for typing up lecture notes for STEM courses.

The project is planned to be created using C# with the Microsoft Visual Studio and the .NET framework.

# Future Goals
We hope to:
- Implement Symbolic calculation functuality in notes, similar to the SymPy library in Python.
- Create a website to enable students to share notes
- Come up with a better name


This project was started by students from University College Cork.
