# notes-app
A little group project for taking notes in STEM courses.
This app is planned to be used as sort of an alternative to using LATEX or sympy for typing up equations and diagrams, as there is some who complain about the overly meticulous format of options such as LATEX.
The goal is to create an intuitive and efficient web app for typing up notes for STEM courses.

The project is planned to be created using the C# language with the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE.

This project was started by students from University College Cork.
